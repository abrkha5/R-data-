# part 2 (a) Histogram of Heading Done
breaks=c(0,5000,10000,15000,20000,25000,30000,35000,40000)
hist(AH$Healing_Done,
     main="Histogram of Alliance Faction Healing",
     xlab="Healing Done",
     ylim=c(0,70),
     breaks)

#2(b)
#The histogram has a longer tail towards the right side. Hence, the distribution
#of Alliance Faction heading_done is not Symmetric but Rightly Skewed.
#The histogram is having frequency=70 for the range [5000,10000), and the rest of
#the frequencies are less than 70. Hence, the histogram is Unimodal as it is a 
#single-mode at [5000,10000).

#2(c) Five Number Summary of the Data
summary(AH$Healing_Done)
# min= 0 
# 1st quartile = 5380
# median = 10808
# mean = 12909
# 3rd quartile = 18097
# Max = 39026

#2(d) Report Sample Mean, Standard Deviation, Sample Size
print(paste("Sample Mean: ", mean(AH$Healing_Done))) # mean = 12908.697
print(paste("Sample Standard Deviation: ", sd(AH$Healing_Done))) # SD = 9692.992
print(paste("Sample Size: ", nrow(AH))) # Sample Size = 294 

#2(e)
#If the sample size is large (n>30), the central limit theorem states that the 
#sampling distribution of the sample means approaches to normal distribution. As
#the sample size is large enough, we do not have any issues in considering the 
#sampling distribution of the sample mean of Alliance Faction Headling done to be
#Normal.


#3(a)
#If µ_1 represents the population mean of Alliance Faction healing done and µ_2
#represents the population means of Horde Faction healing done, then the 
#hypothesis is:
#H_0: µ_1-µ_2=500
#H_a: µ_1-µ_2>500
#As the sample size of both the sampling distribution is large 
#(for Horde Faction, the sample size is 262), the distribution can be 
#approximated to normal. The population variance of the Alliance
#Faction Holding done and Horde Faction holding done is Unknown. Therefore, a
#one-tail independent sample t-test is used.

#Critical Value

#3 (vi)
#The critical region is [1.549, infinity)

#3 (vii)
#The test statistics fall in the critical region; hence, the null hypothesis 
#is rejected. It is concluded that we have statistical evidence that the average 
#number of healings done for the Alliance Faction is higher than the average 
#number of healings done for the Horde Faction by more than 500.

#The p-value of the test statistics is p= 0.05369882
#t.test(x,y, mu=500,alternative="greater" , conf.level=1-0.061)$p.value (CI formula)

#As the p-value is less than 0.061 level of significance, the null hypothesis 
#is rejected, and it is concluded that the average number of healings done for 
#the Alliance Faction is higher than the average number of healings done for the 
#Horde Faction by more than 500.



#3(b)Confidence Interval
ttest$conf.int
# CI = .939 

#The 93.9% confidence interval for the right-tailed two-sample t-test is 
#[548.276,infinity)

#The formula to calculate the confidence interval:
#t.test(x,y, mu=500,alternative="greater", conf.level=1-0.061)$conf.int

#A confidence interval is a measure of certainty in a sampling method. 
#It displays the likelihood of falling of the population mean within an interval.
#If sampling is done 100 times, then a 95% confidence interval is
#the interval in which the value of the estimate will fall 95 times.
#The 93.9% confidence interval has a lower bound of 548.2763, and since the test
#is right-tailed, the upper bound is infinity. We are 93.9% sure that the
#population mean-difference between the Alliance Faction Holding done and the
#Horde Faction holding done is above 548.2763. The confidence 
#interval does not include the null parameter(500); the null hypothesis is
#rejected. In conclusion, the average number of healing done for the 
#Alliance Faction is higher than the average number of healing done for the 
#Horde Faction by more than 500.
